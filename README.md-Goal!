Scoring
A ball outside the left of the box.
a wall in front of the ball.
Keeper on the right not seeing the ball.
Ball bent round bottom left of the wall.
The keeper cant see the ball as the ball goes past the wall.
the ball low, the keepers negitivity in the head getting down to the floor diving maybe hurting himself.
The ball already past the wall as he sees the ball, reactions slower seeing the ball late.
the ball almost in the net before the keeper sees it.
pretty much a goal for certain 99% of the time in that situation.
